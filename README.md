Project Title: CRUD Operation Using Spring and JPA

Description:

The "CRUD Operation Using Spring and JPA" project is a backend application developed to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using the Spring Framework and Java Persistence API (JPA). This project provides endpoints to interact with the database, allowing clients to manage data stored in a SQL database.

Features:

RESTful API Endpoints: Implements RESTful endpoints using Spring MVC to facilitate CRUD operations.
Data Persistence: Utilizes JPA to map Java objects to database tables and perform database operations.
Database Integration: Interacts with a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve data.
Postman Testing: Utilizes Postman to test API endpoints and verify functionality.
Technologies Used:

Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC)
Java Programming Language
Java Persistence API (JPA)
Hibernate as JPA implementation
SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Postman for API testing
Goals:

Provide a backend solution for performing CRUD operations on data stored in a SQL database.
Showcase the integration of Spring Framework with JPA for efficient database interaction.
Validate functionality using Postman to ensure API endpoints are working as expected.
Target Audience:

This project is designed for backend developers and Java enthusiasts interested in learning about backend development with Spring and JPA. It's also suitable for developers familiar with frontend development who want to understand backend data management.

Note:

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex backend systems and can be extended with additional features such as authentication, authorization, validation, and error handling based on specific project requirements.
